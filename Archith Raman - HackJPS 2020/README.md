#Archith Raman Best Web Application HackJPS 2020

This is a README file and this will give an overall idea of the website that I, Archith Raman, designed. The website I made is entered for the Best Web Application category. My website includes 5 pages in total including the login screen for added security. I added a login page to my website with one universal username and password so that people with the username and password can get into my website. The main purpose of my website is to give the audience an overall idea of who I am and what I do during my free time. One page is just a page I designed for fun and is a page that uses the webcam and displays live footage from the webcam. I will make a new Github repository in my Github account, then push this README file along with all the other files I used for my website, and then provide the link to the repository so that the code can be accessed by anyone. Thank you!
